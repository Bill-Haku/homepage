I’m Bill Haku, a Software Development Engineer at Meituan’s Dianping Business Department, where I focus on developing and maintaining search and food discovery features in the Dianping App. I work with a range of front-end technologies to deliver seamless and efficient user experiences.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and completed my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2025.

In 2021, I co-founded Pizza Studio, leading the development of [Pizza Helper for Genshin](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/id1635319193) and other apps, which have collectively garnered 500,000+ downloads and 20,000+ ratings, with an average rating of 4.9 on the App Store.

I’m passionate about building scalable applications, exploring new front-end frameworks, and optimizing search functionalities for better user engagement.

As a member of Zhuai Yuwen, I posted some articles on it and made the website for [ZhuaiYuwen](http://zhuaiyuwen.hakubill.tech).

You can see all my articles about everything as blogs on [iBlog of Bill Haku](http://blog.hakubill.tech). (Written in Chinese)
