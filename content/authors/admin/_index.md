I am a software engineer who loves coding and all new software technologies. My interests include OS Kernel, Artificial Intelligence, iOS & macOS App development, Android App Development and Web page technologies.

My recent new work: **Pizza Helper for Genshin**, a tool for [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com) players to check their resin and other infos in game in app or on Widget. iOS / iPadOS / macOS available. You can download in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%E5%8E%9F%E7%A5%9E%E6%8A%AB%E8%90%A8%E5%B0%8F%E5%8A%A9%E6%89%8B/id1635319193).

Also, I have made the **Pizza Helper for HSR**, a tool for [Honkai: Star Rail](https://hsr.hoyoverse.com) players, which is similar to that for Genshin Impact. You can download in the [App Store](https://download.pizzastudio.org/hsr).

As a member of StarStudio, I am responsible for the development of the iOS and iPadOS Version of the UESTC's official BBS App.

As a member of Zhuai Yuwen, I posted some articles on it and made the website for [ZhuaiYuwen](http://zhuaiyuwen.hakubill.tech).

You can see all my articles about everything as blogs on [iBlog of Bill Haku](http://blog.hakubill.tech). (Written in Chinese)
