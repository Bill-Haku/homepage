# About me

## Name

**My name is Bill Haku.** You may wondering why I'm called Bill Haku, so here I will give you a full explaination.

The first name `Bill` is a common English male name, but infact I got this name inspired from one of my idols when I was young, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft. It is a great achievement for him to create Windows Operating System and make it a home-known name. Supported by one of my English Teacher in my primary school, I got this name until now.

The Last name `Haku` is an expression of my Chinese Family name in English. In fact, you can understand it if you can speak Japanese and know the Roman pronunciation in Japanese. My Chinese Family name shares the same character in Japanese, and it is pronaunced as *Haku* in Japanese, which is easier for most people to read and speak in the world.

> Traditionally, Chinese people call the family name before the first name. Hence, sometimes my public account is called `hakubill`, rather than Bill Haku, the form of habits in English. (eg.: the domain name of this website is `hakubill.tech`)

## My Values

- Something should be free.

  It is one's freedom to say, to write, to publish something although it may be contradicted to the values or principles of some people, including people who are influential.

- I love China and the CPC.

  I love my country, China and I am proud of it. ALso, I love Communism and the Communist Party of China. I support all the laws in People's Republic of China and support the leadership and reasonable instructions of the CPC.

- I support the open-source spirit.

  I support the open-source spirit. All the articles and the whole work is licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). Almost all of my works have been open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com) licensed under [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or other licenses. In addition, I will give priority to open-source softwares in my daily life.

- I support the Internet spirit.

  I stongly oppose the concentration of information and traffic on a certain platform. For example, Wechat Official Accounts. In fact, I've found that it has got the essence of RSS but it limited all the users and content creators on its own platform. I firmly believe that the Internet should be a public space and the entrance of the Internet should be a web browser but a certain application.

  It should be admitted that some social media platforms including [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and [Weibo](https://weibo.com) provided an easier way for common people to express their opinions and share their life. However, the centralized approach is not in line with the Internet spirit.

  Hence, I registered a domain name from [ICANN](https://www.icann.org) and everyone can access [my website](https://hakubill.tech) by a web browser. Also, I recommend everyone to use RSS Feed to get in touch with informations on the Internet.

- I respect the rights and privacy of others.

- I oppose discrimination.
