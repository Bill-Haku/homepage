# About me

## Name

**My name is Bill Haku.** You may wondering why I'm called Bill Haku, so here I will give you a full explaination.

The first name `Bill` is a common English male name, but infact I got this name inspired from one of my idols when I was young, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft. It is a great achievement for him to create Windows Operating System and make it a home-known name. Supported by one of my English Teacher in my primary school, I got this name until now.

The Last name `Haku` is an expression of my Chinese Family name in English. In fact, you can understand it if you can speak Japanese and know the Roman pronunciation in Japanese. My Chinese Family name shares the same character in Japanese, and it is pronaunced as *Haku* in Japanese, which is easier for most people to read and speak in the world.
