# Overview

I'm firmly believe that owning an email address with your own domain suffix is a cool stuff. I've been looking forwart to it since I was very young. However, it was too defficult for a middle school or earlier student to do such a thing as the college entrance exam plays a immense role in a Chinese teenager's life. Fortunately, I have escaped from that and learning software engireneering helped me a lot to achieve this dream. Finally I am glad to tell all on the Internet that my own email address is available now. You can get contact with me by [i@hakubill.tech](mailto:i@hakubill.tech) at any time.

# Preparation

## Hardware

- Synology NAS

    Any model that is currently supported by Synology is acceptable.

    My model is DS418.

    If you install DSM on your own device, maybe it's also acceptable.

## Software

- DSM

    My DSM is version 7.1.

    Maybe DSM 6.0+ is also acceptable.

- Mail Server

    It is an official suite from Synology. You'd better use the newest version.
